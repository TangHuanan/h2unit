h2unit
======

=Light-weight (just like hydrogen) unit test framework for C/C++, especially for C


What is h2unit means? h2 means hydrogen, in Chinese is æ°¢. It's weight is very light and less than air.

Traditional unit test frameworks are become more and more complex. h2unit is a light-weight unit test framework, it only contains two file h2unit.h and h2unit.cpp. This framework is quite automatically: h2unit.cpp includes main() function, so we do not need to write code to initialize framework; Test cases are automatically organized and performed, so we do not need to write code to register test case as CppUnit do.


=Example is the BEST manual document
